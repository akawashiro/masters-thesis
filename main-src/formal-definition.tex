\section{Formal Definition of \LMD \label{sec:formal-definition}}
\label{sec:formal}

In this section, we give a formal definition of \LMD, including
the syntax, full reduction, and type system.  In addition to the full reduction,
in which any redex at any stage can be reduced, we also give staged reduction,
which models program execution (at \(\varepsilon\)-stage).

\subsection{Syntax}

We assume the denumerable set of \emph{type-level constants}, ranged over by
metavariables \(X, Y, Z\), the denumerable set of \emph{variables}, ranged
over by \(x,y,z\), the denumerable set of \emph{constants}, ranged over by
\(c\), and the denumerable set of \emph{stage variables}, ranged over by
\(\alpha, \beta, \gamma\).  The metavariables \(A, B, C\) range over
sequences of stage variables; we write \(\varepsilon\) for the empty
sequence. \LMD is defined by the following grammar:

{%\small
\begin{align*}
   \textrm{kinds}             &  & K,J,I,H,G                & ::= * \mid \Pi x:\tau.K                                                           \\
    \textrm{types}             &  & \tau,\sigma,\rho,\pi,\xi & ::= X \mid \Pi x:\tau.\sigma \mid \tau\ M \mid \TW_{\alpha} \tau \mid \F\alpha.\tau \\
    \textrm{terms}             &  & M,N,L,O,P                & ::= c \mid x \mid \lambda x:\tau.M\ \mid M\ N \mid \TB_\alpha M                   \\
                               &  &                          & \ \ \ \ \mid \TBL_\alpha M \mid \Lambda\alpha.M \mid M\ A \mid \%_\alpha M        \\
    \textrm{signatures}         &  & \Sigma                   & ::= \emptyset \mid \Sigma, X::K \mid \Sigma, c:\tau                               \\
    \textrm{type env.} &  & \Gamma                   & ::= \emptyset \mid  \Gamma,x:\tau @A                                              \\
\end{align*}
}

% Kinds

A kind, which is used to classify types, is either $*$, the kind of
proper types (types that terms inhabit), or $\Pi x\colon\tau.K$, the kind
of type operators that takes $x$ as an argument of type $\tau$ and returns a type
of kind $K$.

% Types

A type is a type-level constant $X$, which is declared in the signature with its kind, a dependent function type $\Pi x:\tau.\sigma$,
an application $\tau\ M$ of a type (operator of $\Pi$-kind) to a term, a code type $\TW_\alpha \tau$, or an $\alpha$-closed type $\F\alpha.\tau$.
An example of an application of a type (operator) of $\Pi$-kind to a term is $\text{Vector}\ 10$; it is well kinded
if, say, the type-level constant $\text{Vector}$ has kind $\Pi x:\I.*$.
A code type $\TW_\alpha \tau$ is for a code fragment of a term of type $\tau$.
An $\alpha$-closed type, when used with $\TW_\alpha$, represents runnable code.

% Terms

Terms include ordinary (explicitly typed) \(\lambda\)-terms, constants,
whose types are declared in signature $\Sigma$, and the following five forms
related to multi-stage programming:
$\TB_\alpha M$ represents a code fragment; $\TBL_\alpha M$ represents escape;
$\Lambda\alpha.M$ is a stage variable abstraction;
$M\ A$ is an application of a stage abstraction $M$ to stage $A$; and
$\%_\alpha M$ is an operator for cross-stage persistence.

% Signature

We adopt the tradition of \LLF-like systems, where types of constants and
kinds of type-level constants are globally declared in a signature $\Sigma$,
which is a sequence of declarations of the form $c:\tau$ and $X::K$. For
example, when we use Boolean in \LMD, $\Sigma$ includes $\B :: *,
\textrm{true}:\B, \textrm{false}:\B$. Type environments are sequences of
triples of a variable, its type, and its stage. We write
\(\textit{dom}(\Sigma)\) and \(\textit{dom}(\Gamma)\) for the set of
(type-level) constants and variables declared in \(\Sigma\) and \(\Gamma\),
respectively. As in other multi-stage
calculi~\cite{taha2003environment,Tsukada,Hanada2014}, a variable declaration
is associated with a stage so that a variable can be referenced only at the
declared stage. On the contrary, constants and type-level constants are
\emph{not} associated with stages; so, they can appear at any stage. We
define well-formed signatures and well-formed type environments later.

% Free and bound variables

The variable $x$ is bound in $M$ by $\lambda x:\tau.M$ and in $\sigma$ by $\Pi
x:\tau.\sigma$, as usual; the stage variable $\alpha$ is bound in $M$ by
$\Lambda \alpha.M$ and $\tau$ by $\F\alpha.\tau$.  The notion of free variables
is defined in a standard manner.  We write $\FV(M)$ and $\FTV(M)$ for the set
of free variables and the set of free stage variables in $M$, respectively.
Similarly, $\FV(\tau)$, $\FTV(\tau)$, $\FV(K)$, and $\FTV(K)$ are defined.  We
sometimes abbreviate $\Pi x:\tau_1.\tau_2$ to $\tau_1 \rightarrow \tau_2$ if
$x$ is not a free variable of $\tau_2$.  We identify $\alpha$-convertible terms
and assume the names of bound variables are pairwise distinct.

% Primitives of multi-stage programming

The prefix operators $\TW_\alpha, \TB_\alpha, \TBL_\alpha$, and $\%_\alpha$ are
given higher precedence over the three forms $\tau\ M$, $M\ N$, $M\ A$ of
applications, which are left-associative. The binders $\Pi$, $\forall$, and
$\lambda$ extend as far to the right as possible.  Thus, $\F\alpha.\TW_{\alpha}
(\Pi x:\I.\text{Vector}\ 5)$ is interpreted as $\F\alpha.(\TW_{\alpha} (\Pi
x:\I.(\text{Vector}\ 5)))$; and $\Lambda\alpha.\lambda x:\I.\TB_\alpha x\ y$
means $\Lambda\alpha.(\lambda x:\I.(\TB_\alpha x)\ y)$.

% Remark on restriction of \LMD

\paragraph{Remark:} Basically, we define \LMD to be an extension of \LTP with
dependent types. One notable difference is that \LMD has only one kind of
\(\alpha\)-closed types, whereas \LTP has two kinds of \(\alpha\)-closed types
\(\forall\alpha.\tau\) and \(\forall^\varepsilon\alpha.\tau\).  We have omitted
the first kind, for simplicity, and dropped the superscript $\varepsilon$ from
the second. It would not be difficult to recover the distinction to show
properties related to program residualization~\cite{Hanada2014}, although they
are left as conjectures.

\subsection{Reduction}

% Substitutions

Next, we define full reduction for \LMD.  Before giving the definition of
reduction, we define two kinds of substitutions. Substitution $M[x\mapsto N],
\tau[x \mapsto N]$ and $K[x \mapsto N]$ are ordinary capture-avoiding
substitution of term $N$ for $x$ in term $M$, type $\tau$, and kind $K$,
respectively, and we omit their definitions here.  Substitution $M[\alpha
\mapsto A], \tau [\alpha \mapsto A], K[\alpha \mapsto A]$ and $B[\alpha\mapsto
A]$ are substitutions of stage $A$ for stage variable $\alpha$ in term $M$,
type $\tau$, kind $K$, and stage $B$, respectively.  We show representative
cases below.

\begin{align*}
    (\lambda x:\tau.M)[\alpha \mapsto A] & = \lambda x:(\tau[\alpha \mapsto A]).(M[\alpha \mapsto A])                                  \\
    (M\ B)[\alpha \mapsto A]             & = (M[\alpha \mapsto A])\ B[\alpha\mapsto A]                                                 \\
    (\TB_\beta M)[\alpha \mapsto A]      & = \TB_{\beta[\alpha \mapsto A]}M[\alpha \mapsto A]                                          \\
    (\TBL_\beta M)[\alpha \mapsto A]     & = \TBL_{\beta[\alpha \mapsto A]}M[\alpha \mapsto A]                                         \\
    (\%_\beta M)[\alpha \mapsto A]       & = \%_{\beta[\alpha \mapsto A]}M[\alpha \mapsto A]                                           \\
    (\beta B)[\alpha \mapsto A]          & = \beta (B[\alpha\mapsto A])                               & (\text{if } \alpha \neq \beta) \\
    (\beta B)[\alpha \mapsto A]          & = A (B[\alpha\mapsto A])                                   & (\text{if } \alpha = \beta)
\end{align*}

% Series of stage variables

Here, $\TB_{\alpha_1\cdots\alpha_n} M$, $\TBL_{\alpha_1\cdots\alpha_n} M$, and
$\%_{\alpha_1\cdots\alpha_n} M$ $(n \geq 0)$ stand for $\TB_{\alpha_1} \cdots
\TB_{\alpha_n} M$, $\TBL_{\alpha_n}\cdots \TBL_{\alpha_1} M$, and
$\%_{\alpha_n}\cdots \%_{\alpha_1} M$, respectively.  In particular,
$\TB_{\varepsilon} M = \TBL_{\varepsilon} M = \%_{\varepsilon} M = M$.  Also,
it is important that the order of stage variables is reversed for $\TBL$ and
$\%$.  We also define substitutions of a stage or a term for variables in type
environment $\G$.

% Reduction

Next, we define the reduction relation of \LMD. There are three basic
reductions, $M \longrightarrow_\beta N$, $M \longrightarrow_\blacklozenge N$,
and $M \longrightarrow_\Lambda N$.  The relation $\longrightarrow_\beta$
represents ordinary $\beta$-reduction in the \(\lambda\)-calculus; the relation
$\longrightarrow_\blacklozenge$ represents that quotation $\TB_\alpha M$ is
canceled by escape and $M$ is spliced into the code fragment surrounding the
escape; the relation $\longrightarrow_\Lambda$ means that a stage abstraction
applied to  stage $A$ reduces to the body of the abstraction where $A$ is
substituted for the stage variable.  There is no reduction rule for CSP as with
Hanada and Igarashi \cite{Hanada2014}.  The CSP operator $\%_\alpha$ disappears
when $\varepsilon$ is substituted for $\alpha$.

\begin{definition}[Basic reduction]
    The relations $M \longrightarrow_\beta N$, $M \longrightarrow_\blacklozenge N$, and $M \longrightarrow_\Lambda N$ are defined as following.
\begin{center}
  \begin{align*}
     & (\lambda x:\tau.M) N \longrightarrow_\beta M[x \mapsto N]         \\
     & \TBL_\alpha (\TB_\alpha M)\longrightarrow_\blacklozenge M         \\
     & (\Lambda \alpha.M)\ A \longrightarrow_\Lambda M[\alpha \mapsto A]
  \end{align*}
\end{center}
\end{definition}

Then, we define level \( n \) reduction, \( M \longrightarrow_n M' \). Because
we compare two terms with \( \alpha \) equivalence in the algorithmic typing,
we must reduce terms in type annotations.  Intuitively, the level of reduction
represents the number of nested colon ":" which is used in type annotations. 

\begin{definition}[Leveled reduction]
    The relations \( M \longrightarrow_i M' \) are defined as following.
    \begin{center}
        \infrule{M\longrightarrow_\text{basic}M'}{M\longrightarrow_0 M'} \\[2mm]
        \infrule{M \longrightarrow_i M'}{\lambda x:\tau.M \longrightarrow_i \lambda x:\tau.M'} \hfil
        \infrule{\tau \longrightarrow_i \tau'}{\lambda x:\tau.M \longrightarrow_{i+1} \lambda x:\tau'.M} \hfil
        \infrule{M \longrightarrow_i M'}{M\ N \longrightarrow_i M'\ N} \hfil
        \infrule{N \longrightarrow_i N'}{M\ N \longrightarrow_i M\ N'} \hfil
        \infrule{M \longrightarrow_i M'}{\TB_\alpha M \longrightarrow_i \TB_\alpha M'} \\[2mm]
        \infrule{M \longrightarrow_i M'}{\TBL_\alpha M \longrightarrow_i \TBL_\alpha M'} \hfil
        \infrule{M \longrightarrow_i M'}{\Lambda\alpha.M \longrightarrow_i \Lambda\alpha.M'} \hfil
        \infrule{M \longrightarrow_i M'}{M\ A \longrightarrow_i M'\ A} \hfil
        \infrule{M \longrightarrow_i M'}{\%_\alpha M \longrightarrow_i \%_\alpha M'} \\[2mm]
        \infrule{\tau \longrightarrow_i \tau'}{\Pi x:\tau \longrightarrow_{i+1} \Pi x:\tau'} \hfil
        \infrule{\tau \longrightarrow_i \tau'}{\tau\ M \longrightarrow_i \tau'\ M} \hfil
        \infrule{M \longrightarrow_i M'}{\tau\ M \longrightarrow_i \tau\ M'} \hfil
        \infrule{\tau \longrightarrow_i \tau'}{\TW_\alpha\tau \longrightarrow_i \TW_\alpha\tau'} \hfil
        \infrule{\tau \longrightarrow_i \tau'}{\forall\alpha.\tau \longrightarrow_i \forall\alpha.\tau'}
    \end{center}
\end{definition}

Finally, we define the reduction relation of \LMD.

\begin{definition}[Term reduction]
    \( M \longrightarrow M' \) if and only if there is \( n \) such that \( M
    \longrightarrow_n M' \).
\end{definition}

We show an example of a reduction sequence in Figure \ref{fig:example-of-reduction}. Underlines show the redexes.

\begin{figure}[tbp]
\begin{align*}
    & \hspace{10mm} \underline{(\lambda f:\I\to\I.(\Lambda\alpha.\TB_\alpha (\%_\alpha f\ 1 + (\TBL_\alpha \TB_\alpha 3))\ \varepsilon))\ (\lambda x:\I.x)} \\
    & \longrightarrow_\beta (\Lambda\alpha.\TB_\alpha (\%_\alpha (\lambda x:\I.x)\ 1 + (\underline{\TBL_\alpha \TB_\alpha 3})))\ \varepsilon        \\
    & \longrightarrow_\blacklozenge \underline{(\Lambda\alpha.\TB_\alpha (\%_\alpha (\lambda x:\I.x)\ 1 + 3))\ \varepsilon}                                         \\
    & \longrightarrow_\Lambda \underline{(\lambda x:\I.x)\ 1} + 3                                                                                           \\
    & \longrightarrow_\beta 1 + 3                                                                                                                           \\
    & \longrightarrow^* 4
\end{align*}
    \caption{Example of reduction.}
    \label{fig:example-of-reduction}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Type System}

In this section, we define the type system of \LMD.  It consists of eight
judgment forms for signature well-formedness, type environment well-formedness,
kind well-formedness, kinding, typing, kind equivalence, type equivalence, and
term equivalence.  We list the judgment forms in
Figure~\ref{fig:LMD-six-judgments}.  They are all defined in a mutual recursive
manner.  We will discuss each judgment below.

\begin{figure}[tbp]
    \begin{center}
    \begin{align*}
      \vdash & \Sigma                     & \text{signature well-formedness}        \\
      \V     & \G                         & \text{type environment well-formedness} \\
      \G     & \V K \iskind @ A           & \text{kind well-formedness}             \\
      \G     & \V \tau :: K @ A           & \text{kinding}                          \\
      \G     & \V M : \tau @ A            & \text{typing}                           \\
      \G     & \V K \E J @ A              & \text{kind equivalence}                 \\
      \G     & \V \tau \E \sigma :: K @ A & \text{type equivalence}                 \\
      \G     & \V M \E N : \tau @ A       & \text{term equivalence}
    \end{align*}
    \caption{Eight judgment forms of the type system of \LMD.}
    \label{fig:LMD-six-judgments}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Signature and Type Environment Well-formedness.}
The rules for Well-formed signatures and type environments are
shown below:
%
{\small
\begin{center}
  \infrule{
  }{
    \vdash \emptyset
  }
  \hfil
  \infrule{
    \vdash \Sigma \andalso
    \V K \iskind @ \varepsilon \\
    X\notin\textit{dom}(\Sigma)
  }{
    \vdash \Sigma, X::K
  }
  \hfil
  \infrule{
    \vdash \Sigma \andalso
    \V \tau :: * @ \varepsilon \\
    c\notin\textit{dom}(\Sigma)
  }{
    \vdash \Sigma, c:\tau
  }
  \\[2mm]
  \infrule{
  }{
    \V \emptyset
  }
  \hfil
  \infrule{
    \V \Gamma \andalso
    \Gamma \V \tau :: * @ A \andalso
    x\notin\textit{dom}(\Sigma)
  }{
    \V \Gamma, x:\tau@A
  }
\end{center}
}

To add declarations to a signature, the kind/type of a (type-level)
constant has to be well-formed at stage \(\varepsilon\) so that it is
used at any stage.  In what follows, well-formedness is not explicitly
mentioned but we assume that all signatures and type environments are
well-formed.

\subsubsection{Kind Well-formedness and Kinding.}

The rules for kind well-formedness and kinding are a straightforward adaptation
from \LLF and \LTP. So, we omit the definitions.

\subsubsection{Typing.}
\label{sec:typing}

\begin{figure}[tbp]
  \begin{center}
    \infrule[\TConst]{c:\tau \in \Sigma}{\G \V c:\tau @A} \hfil
    \infrule[\TVar]{x:\tau @A \in \G}{\G \V x:\tau @A} \\[2mm]
    \infrule[\TAbs]{\G\V \sigma::*@A\andalso\G,x:\sigma@A\V M:\tau @A}{\G\V(\lambda (x:\sigma).M):(\Pi (x:\sigma).\tau)@A} \\[2mm]
    \infrule[\TApp]{\G\V M:(\Pi (x:\sigma).\tau)@A \andalso \G\V N:\sigma@A}{\G\V M\ N : \tau[x\mapsto N]@A} \\[2mm]
    \infrule[\TConv]{\G\V M:\tau @A \andalso \G\V \tau\equiv \sigma :: K@A}{\G\V M:\sigma@A} \\[2mm]
    \infrule[\TTB]{\G\V M:\tau @{A\alpha}}{\G\V\TB_{\alpha}M:\TW_{\alpha}\tau @A} \andalso
    \infrule[\TTBL]{\G\V M:\TW_{\alpha}\tau @A}{\G\V\TBL_{\alpha}M:\tau @{A\alpha}} \\[2mm]
    \infrule[\TGen]{\G\V M:\tau @A \andalso \alpha\notin\rm{FTV}(\G)\cup\rm{FTV}(A)}{\G\V\Lambda\alpha.M:\forall\alpha.\tau @A} \\[2mm]
    \infrule[\TIns]{\G\V M:\forall\alpha.\tau @A}{\G\V M\ B:\tau[\alpha \mapsto B]@A} \andalso
    \infrule[\TCsp]{
        \G\V M:\tau@A \andalso \G\V \tau::*@{A\alpha}
    }{
      \G\V \%_\alpha M:\tau@{A\alpha}
    }
    \caption{Typing Rules.}
    \label{fig:typing-rules}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

The typing rules of \LMD are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:typing-rules}.
The rule \TConst{} means that a constant can appear at any stage.
The rules \TVar, \TAbs, and \TApp{} are almost the same as those in the simply typed
lambda calculus or \LLF.  Additional conditions are that subterms must be
typed at the same stage (\TAbs{} and \TApp); the type
annotation/declaration on a variable has to be a proper type of kind
$*$ (\TAbs) at the stage where it is declared (\TVar{} and \TAbs).

% \TConv

As in standard dependent type systems, \TConv{} allows us to replace the type
of a term with an equivalent one. For example, assuming integers and
arithmetic, a value of type $\textrm{Vector}\ (4+1)$ can also have type
$\textrm{Vector}\ 5$ because of \TConv{}.

% Typing rules for a multi-stage calculus

The rules \TTB, \TTBL, \TGen, \TIns, and \TCsp{} are constructs for multi-stage
programming. \TTB{} and \TTBL{} are the same as in \LTP, as we explained in
Section \ref{sec:informal-overview}. The rule \TGen{} for stage abstraction is
straightforward. The condition $\alpha\notin\rm{FTV}(\G)\cup\rm{FTV}(A)$
ensures that the scope of $\alpha$ is in $M$, and avoids capturing variables
elsewhere. The rule \TIns{} is for applications of stages to stage
abstractions. The rule \TCsp{} is for CSP, which means that, if term $M$ is of
type $\tau$ at stage $A$ and type \( \tau \) is also legitimate at stage \(
A\alpha \), then $\%_\alpha M$ is of type $\tau$ at stage $A\alpha$. Note that
CSP is also applied to the type \(\tau\) (although it is implicit) in the
conclusion. Thanks to implicit CSP, the typing rule is the same as in \LTP.

\subsubsection{Kind, Type and Term Equivalence.}

Since the syntax of kinds, types, and terms is mutually recursive, the
corresponding notions of equivalence are also mutually recursive.  They are
congruences closed under a few axioms for term equivalence.  Thus, the rules
for kind and type equivalences are not very interesting, except that implicit
CSP is allowed.  We show a few representative rules below.

\begin{center}
    \infrule[\textsc{QK-Csp}]{%
        \G\V K \E J @ A
        }{
            \G\V K \E J @ A\alpha
        }
        \hfil
        \infrule[\QTCsp]{
            \G\V \tau \E \sigma :: *@A
        }{
            \G\V \tau \E \sigma :: *@{A\alpha}
        }
        \\[2mm]
        \infrule[\QTApp]{%
            \G\V \tau \E \sigma :: (\Pi x:\rho.K)@A \andalso
            \G\V M \E N : \rho @A
            }{
                \G\V \tau\ M \E \sigma\ N :: K[x \mapsto M]@A
            }
\end{center}

We show the rules for term equivalence  in
Figure~\ref{fig:term-equivalence-rules}, omitting straightforward rules for
reflexivity, symmetry, transitivity, and compatibility.  The rules \QBeta,
\QTBLTB, and \QLambda{} correspond to $\beta$-reduction,
$\blacklozenge$-reduction, and $\Lambda$-reduction, respectively.

\begin{figure}[tbp]
    \begin{center}
   \infrule[\QBeta]{\G,x:\sigma@A\V M:\tau @A \andalso \G\V N:\sigma@A}{\G\V(\lambda x:\sigma.M)\ N\E M[x\mapsto N] : \tau[x \mapsto N]@A} \\[2mm]
    \infrule[\QLambda]{\G\V (\Lambda\alpha.M) : \forall\alpha.\tau @A}{\G\V (\Lambda\alpha.M)\ \varepsilon \E M[\alpha \mapsto \varepsilon] : \tau[\alpha \mapsto \varepsilon]@A} \\[2mm]
    \infrule[\QTBLTB]{\G\V M \E N : \tau @A}{\G\V \TBL_\alpha(\TB_\alpha M) \E N : \tau @A} \hfil
    \infrule[\QPercent]{\G\V M:\tau @{A\alpha} \andalso \G\V M:\tau @A}{\G\V\%_\alpha M \E M : \tau @{A\alpha}}
    \caption{Term Equivalence Rules.}
    \label{fig:term-equivalence-rules}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

% \QPercentの説明
The only rule that deserves elaboration is the last rule \QPercent.
Intuitively, it means that the CSP operator applied to term $M$ can be
removed if $M$ is also well-typed at the next stage \(A\alpha\).
For example, constants do not depend on the stage (see \TConst) and
so \(\G\V \%_\alpha c \E c : \tau @ A\alpha\) holds but variables
do depend on stages and so this rule does not apply.

\subsubsection{Example.}

We show an example of a dependently typed code generator in a
hypothetical language based on \LTP.  
% This rule is motivated by a practical consideration.
This language provides definitions by \textbf{let},
recursive functions (represented by \textbf{fix}), \textbf{if}-expressions,
and primitives cons, head, and tail to manipulate vectors. We assume that
$\text{cons}$ is of type $\Pi n:\I.\I \to \text{Vector}\ n \to \text{Vector}\ (n+1)$, 
$\text{head}$ is of type $\Pi n:\I.\text{Vector}\ (n+1) \to \I$, and
$\text{tail}$ is of type $\Pi n:\I.\text{Vector}\ (n+1) \to (\text{Vector}\ n)$.

Let's consider an application, for example, in computer graphics, in which we
have potentially many pairs of vectors of the fixed (but statically unknown)
length and a function---such as vector addition---to be applied to
them. This function should be fast because it is applied many times and be
safe because just one runtime error may ruin the whole long-running calculation.

\newcommand{\Vpn}{\text{Vector}\ (\%_\alpha n)}

Our goal is to define the function vadd of type
\[
  \Pi n:\I.\F\beta.\TW_\beta(\Vpn\to\Vpn\to\Vpn).
\]
\renewcommand{\Vpn}{\text{Vector}\ n}
It takes the length $n$ and returns ($\beta$-closed) code of a
function to add two vectors of length $n$.  The generated
code is run by applying it to \(\varepsilon\) to obtain
a function of type \(\Vpn\to\Vpn\to\Vpn\) as expected.

We start with the helper function vadd$_1$, which takes a stage, the length $n$ of vectors, and two quoted vectors as arguments and returns code that computes the addition of the given two vectors:
%
\begin{tabbing}
	  $\textbf{let}\ \text{vadd}_1 : \F\alpha.\Pi n:\I.\TW_\alpha\Vpn\to\TW_\alpha\Vpn\to\TW_\alpha\Vpn$                                \\
	  \hspace{6mm} \= $= \textbf{fix}\ f.\Lambda\alpha.\lambda n:\I.\ \lambda v_1:\TW_\alpha\Vpn.\ \lambda v_2:\TW_\alpha\Vpn.$            \\
	  \> \hspace{6mm} \= $\textbf{if}\ n = 0 \ \textbf{then}\ \TB_\alpha \text{nil}$ \\
	  \>\> $\textbf{else}\ \TB_\alpha ($ \= $\textbf{let}\ t_1 = \text{tail}\ (\TBL_\alpha v_1)\ \textbf{in}$ \\
	  \>\>\> $\textbf{let}\ t_2 = \text{tail}\ (\TBL_\alpha v_2)\ \textbf{in}$ \\
          \>\>\> $\text{cons}\ $\= $(\text{head}\ (\TBL_\alpha v_1) + \text{head} \ (\TBL_\alpha v_2))$ \\
          \>\>\>\> $\TBL_\alpha (f\ (n-1)\ (\TB_\alpha t_1)\ (\TB_\alpha t_2)))$
\end{tabbing}
Note that the generated code will not contain branching on $n$ or recursion.
(Here, we assume that the type system can determine whether $n=0$ when
\textbf{then}- and \textbf{else}-branches are typechecked so that
both branches can be given type \(\TW_\alpha \text{Vector }n\).)

Using vadd$_1$, the main function vadd can be defined as follows:
\renewcommand{\Vpn}{\text{Vector}\ (\%_\beta n)}
\begin{align*}
	  & \textbf{let}\ \text{vadd}: \Pi n:\I.\F\beta.\TW_\beta(\Vpn\to\Vpn\to\Vpn)                \\ 
	  & \hspace{6mm} = \lambda n:\I.\Lambda\beta.\TB_\beta (\lambda v_1:\Vpn.\ \lambda v_2:\Vpn. \\
	  & \hspace{63mm} \TBL_\beta (\text{vadd}_1\ \beta\ n\ (\TB_\beta\ v_1)\ (\TB_\beta\ v_2))) 
\end{align*}
\renewcommand{\Vpn}{\text{Vector}\ (\%_\beta 5)}%
The auxiliary function vadd$_1$ generates code to compute addition of
the formal arguments $v_1$ and $v_2$ without branching on $n$ or recursion.
As we mentioned already, if this function is applied to a
(nonnegative) integer constant, say 5, it returns function code for adding
two vectors of size 5.  The type of vadd\ 5, obtained by
substituting 5 for $n$, is
$\F\beta.\TW_\beta(\Vpn\to\Vpn\to\Vpn)$.
\renewcommand{\Vpn}{\text{Vector}\ 5}
If the obtained code is run by applying to \(\varepsilon\),
the type of vadd\ 5\ $\varepsilon$ is
\(\Vpn\to\Vpn\to\Vpn\) as expected.

There are other ways to implement the vector addition function:
by using tuples instead of lists if the length
for all the vectors is statically known or by checking dynamically the
lengths of lists for every pair.  However, our method is better than
these alternatives in two points.  First, our function, $\text{vadd}_1$
can generate functions for vectors of arbitrary length unlike the one
using tuples.  Second, $\text{vadd}_1$ has an advantage in speed over
the one using dynamic checking because it can generate an optimized
function for a given length.

\paragraph{Remark:}
If the generated function code is composed with another piece of code of type, say,
\(\TW_\gamma \text{Vector }5\), \QPercent{} plays an essential role; that is,
\(\text{Vector }5\) and \(\text{Vector }(\%_\gamma 5)\), which would occur
by applying the generated code to \(\gamma\) (instead of \(\varepsilon\)), are syntactically
different types but \QPercent{} enables to equate them.
Interestingly, Hanada and Igarashi~\cite{Hanada2014} rejected the idea of
reduction that removes $\%_\alpha$ when they developed \LTP{}, as such
reduction does not match the operational behavior of the CSP operator in
implementations. However, as an equational system for multi-stage programs,
the rule \QPercent{} makes sense.

\subsection{Algorithmic Typing}

\AK{What should I call "normal typing" as? → Use "original typing" in this thesis.}

% What is algorithmic typing?

Algorithmic typing rules are rules for the implementation of type inference
program which takes an environment \( \Gamma \), a signature \( \Sigma \), a
term \( M \), and a stage \( A \) and returns a type \( \tau \) which satisfies
\( \G \V M : \tau @ A \). If there is no such \( \tau \), the algorithm tells
failure.  We already defined typing rules for \LMD in Section \ref{sec:typing},
but they include some non-syntax directed rules. Non-syntax directed rules mean
their premise cannot be decided from the goal. When we implement the type
inference program of \LMD, it is necessary to make up type derivation trees
from bottom to up.  So, we need to make all the typing rules syntax-directed so
that algorithmic typing is equivalent to the original typing. Using this
algorithmic typing, we can make the type inference program easily just by
applying the unique suitable rule one by one. We show the equivalence in
Section \ref{sec:properties}.

% Judgements

In algorithmic typing, there are 8 judgments as with original typing in Figure
\ref{fig:LMD-six-judgments} i.e., well-formed signature, well-formed
environment, well-formed kinding, kinding, typing, kind equivalence, type
equivalence, and term equivalence. We replace \( \V \) with \( \AV \) in
judgments to distinguish them from judgments of the original typing and omit
kinds and types from typing equivalence and term equivalence, respectively. The
definitions of well-formed signature, well-formed environment, and well-formed
kinding are the same with original typing, so we don't explain them here.

% Kinding rules and typing rules

Kinding and typing rules are almost the same as the original typing, but there
are no conversion rules, such as \TConv and \KConv. Conversion rules are not
syntax-directed because we can apply them at any typing or kinding judgments.
Thus, we must remove them from algorithmic typing.  As you can see in
\cite{attapl}, all uses of conversion rules in a dependent type system can be
put into application rules. The simplification is possible because only
application rules check the equivalence between the actual argument and formal
argument, but all other rules don't check the equality of types. Therefore, the
equivalence of types becomes a problem only in application rules. Then, if we
replace type equality checks in application rules with a conversion check, we
can eliminate conversion rules from algorithmic typing. The two application
rules are as follows.

\begin{center}
    {\small
    \infrule[{\KAApp}]{
        \G\AVS \sigma:: (\Pi x:\tau.K)@A \andalso 
        \G\AVS M:\tau'@A \\
        \G\AVS \tau' :: * @ A \andalso 
        \G\AVS \tau \E \tau' @ A
    }{
        \G\AVS \sigma\ M::K[x\mapsto M]@A
    } \hfil
    \infrule[\TAApp]{
        \G\AVS M:(\Pi (x:\sigma).\tau) \andalso
        \G\AVS N:\sigma'@A \\
        \G\AVS \sigma' :: * @ A \andalso
        \G\AVS \sigma\E\sigma' @A
    }{
        \G\AVS M\ N : \tau[x\mapsto N]@A
    } 
    }
\end{center}

% Kind and type equivalence rules

The difference between kind and type equivalence rules of the normal typing and
the algorithmic typing is that there are no rules for transitivity, symmetry,
and reflexivity in the algorithmic typing. Because they are non-syntax
directed, we must remove them. Instead of including them in the rules, we prove
transitivity, symmetry, and reflexivity as meta theorems.

% Term equivalence rules -- especially on ANF

Unlike all other rules of the algorithmic typing, term equivalence rules of the
algorithmic typing is completely different from the original ones. We replaced
all rules of term equivalence with \QAANF. Although the original equivalence
rules check the equivalence of terms by constructing a derivation tree, the
algorithmic equivalence rules calculate the normal form of two terms and
compare them just with \( \alpha \) equivalence. \( \ANF(M) \) is the normal
form of \( M \) under algorithmic reduction which is defined in Figure
\ref{fig:algorithmic-reduction}. Algorithmic reduction is composed of normal
reductions of \LMD, which are \textsc{(A-$\beta$)}, \textsc{(A-$\TBL\TB$)}, and
\textsc{(A-$\Lambda$)}, and one special reduction \textsc{(A-$\%$)}, which
corresponds to \QPercent in the normal term equivalence rules. Just same as the
normal reduction \( M \longrightarrow M' \), we define level 0 algorithmic reduction and
level \( n \) algorithmic reduction.

\subsection{Staged Semantics}

The reduction given above is full reduction and any redexes---even under
$\TB_\alpha$---can be reduced in an arbitrary order.  Following previous
work~\cite{Hanada2014}, we introduce (small-step, call-by-value) staged
semantics, where only $\beta$-reduction or $\Lambda$-reduction at stage
$\varepsilon$ or the outer-most $\blacklozenge$-reduction are allowed, modeling
an implementation. Please note that we deal only with reductions on level 0
subterms.

We start with the definition of values. Since terms under quotations are
not executed, the grammar is indexed by stages.

\begin{definition}[Values]
  The family $V^A$ of sets of values, ranged over by $v^A$,
  is defined by the following grammar.  In the grammar, $A' \neq \varepsilon$ is assumed.
  \begin{align*}
    v^\varepsilon \in V^\varepsilon & ::= \lambda x:\tau.M \mid\ \TB_\alpha v^\alpha \mid \Lambda\alpha.v^\varepsilon                                             & \\
    v^{A'} \in V^{A'}               & ::= x \mid \lambda x:\tau.v^{A'} \mid v^{A'}\ v^{A'} \mid\ \TB_\alpha v^{A'\alpha} \mid \Lambda\alpha.v^{A'} \mid v^{A'}\ B & \\
                                    & \quad\   \mid\ \TBL_\alpha v^{A''} (\text{if } A' = A''\alpha \text{ for some } \alpha, A'' \neq \varepsilon)               & \\
                                    & \quad\   \mid\ \%_\alpha v^{A''} (\text{if } A' = A''\alpha)
  \end{align*}
\end{definition}

Values at stage $\varepsilon$ are $\lambda$-abstractions, quoted pieces of
code, or $\Lambda$-abstractions. The body of a $\lambda$-abstraction can be any
term but the body of $\Lambda$-abstraction has to be a value.  It means that
the body of $\Lambda$-abstraction must be evaluated.  The side condition for
$\TBL_\alpha v^{A'}$ means that escapes in a value can appear only under nested
quotations because an escape under a single quotation will splice the code
value into the surrounding code. See Hanada and Igarashi~\cite{Hanada2014} for
details.

In order to define staged reduction, we define redex and evaluation contexts.

\begin{definition}[Redex]
  The sets of $\varepsilon$-redexes (ranged over by $R^\varepsilon$) and $\alpha$-redexes (ranged over by $R^\alpha$) are defined by the following grammar.
  \begin{align*}
     & R^\varepsilon ::= (\lambda x:\tau.M)\ v^\varepsilon \mid (\Lambda\alpha.v^\varepsilon)\ \varepsilon \\
     & R^\alpha      ::=\ \TBL_\alpha \TB_\alpha v^\alpha                                                         \\
  \end{align*}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Evaluation Context]
  Let $B$ be either \(\varepsilon\) or a stage variable \(\beta\).
  The family of sets $ECtx^A_B$ of evaluation contexts, ranged over by $E^A_B$, is defined by the following grammar (in which $A'$ stands for a non-empty stage).
  %  $A$ is assumed to be nonempty (but $B,A'$ can be empty).
  \begin{align*}
    E^\varepsilon_B \in ECtx^\varepsilon_B & ::= \square\ (\text{if\ } B = \varepsilon)
    \mid E^\varepsilon_B\ M \mid v^\varepsilon\ E^\varepsilon_B \mid \TB_\alpha E^\alpha_B
    \mid \Lambda\alpha.E^\varepsilon_B \mid E^\varepsilon_B\ A                                                                                    \\
    E^{A'}_B \in ECtx^{A'}_B               & ::= \square\ (\text{if } A' = B) \mid \lambda x:\tau.E^{A'}_B \mid E^{A'}_B\ M \mid v^{A'}\ E^{A'}_B \\
                                           & \mid \TB_\alpha E^{A'\alpha}_B \mid \TBL_\alpha E^{A}_B \ (\text{where } A\alpha = A')               \\
                                           & \mid \Lambda\alpha.E^{A'}_B \mid E^{A'}_B\ A \mid \%_\alpha\ E^{A}_B \ (\text{where } A\alpha = A')
  \end{align*}
\end{definition}

The subscripts $A$ and $B$ in $E^A_B$ stand for the stage of the evaluation
context and of the hole, respectively. The grammar represents that staged
reduction is left-to-right and call-by-value and terms under \(\Lambda\) are
reduced. Terms at non-$\varepsilon$ stages are not reduced, except redexes of
the form \(\TBL_\alpha \TB_\alpha v^\alpha\) at stage \(\alpha\).  A few
examples of evaluation contexts are shown below:
\begin{align*}
  \square\ (\lambda x:\I.x)                  & \in  ECtx^\varepsilon_\varepsilon \\
  \Lambda\alpha.\square\ \varepsilon            & \in ECtx^\varepsilon_\varepsilon  \\
  \TBL_\alpha \TB_\alpha \TBL_\alpha \square & \in ECtx^\alpha_\varepsilon
\end{align*}
We write $E^A_B[M]$ for the term obtained by filling the hole $\square$ in $E^A_B$ by $M$.

Now we define staged reduction using the redex and evaluation contexts.

\begin{definition}[Staged Reduction]\sloppy
  The staged reduction relation, written $M \longrightarrow_s N$, is defined by
  the least relation closed under the rules below.
  \begin{align*}
    E^A_\varepsilon [(\lambda x:\tau.M)\ v^\varepsilon] & \longrightarrow_s E^A_\varepsilon[M[x\mapsto v^\varepsilon]]      \\
    E^A_\varepsilon [(\Lambda\alpha.v^\varepsilon)\ A]  & \longrightarrow_s E^A_\varepsilon[v^\varepsilon[\alpha\mapsto A]] \\
    E^A_\alpha [\TBL_\alpha \TB_\alpha v^\alpha]        & \longrightarrow_s E^A_\alpha[v^\alpha]                            \\
  \end{align*}
\end{definition}

This reduction relation reduces a term in a deterministic, left-to-right,
call-by-value manner. An application of an abstraction is executed only at
stage \(\varepsilon\) and only a quotation at stage \(\varepsilon\) is spliced
into the surrounding code---notice that, if \(\TB_\alpha v^\alpha\) is at stage
\(\varepsilon\), then the redex \(\TBL_\alpha \TB_\alpha v^\alpha\) is at stage
\(\alpha\). In other words, terms in brackets are not evaluated until the terms
are run and arguments of a function are evaluated before the application.  We
show an example of staged reduction. Underlines show the redexes.
\begin{align*}
                    & (\Lambda\alpha.(\TB_\alpha \underline{\TBL_\alpha \TB_\alpha ((\lambda x:\I.x)\ 10))})\ \varepsilon \\
  \longrightarrow_s & \underline{(\Lambda\alpha.(\TB_\alpha ((\lambda x:\I.x)\ 10)))\ \varepsilon}                        \\
  \longrightarrow_s & \underline{(\lambda x:\I.x)\ 10}                                                                    \\
  \longrightarrow_s & 10
\end{align*}
